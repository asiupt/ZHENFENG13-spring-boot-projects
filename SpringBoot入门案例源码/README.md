Friends who are familiar with me should know that when I write tutorials, I usually provide "articles" + "source code" + "demo website" at the same time. Therefore, after the course is completed, all source codes will be shared with every student for use. For learning and practice, the content of this course is mainly to introduce ideas. Based on the technology and development skills explained in this practical project and the implementation of each individual function point, it can be transformed into any enterprise development project in conjunction with its own business.
